    "summary": "Hi, my name is <strong>Carlan</strong>. I'm a <strong>senior software engineer / ninja</strong>, for the past 10 years I've been analysing business rules in an IT environment, identifying and developing solutions with best practices in various technologies. During these years I've involved myself in the whole development cycle from requirements specification, development of specifications and software development as single developer or an active member of a agile team. I'm a full-stack developer and in the past 5 years I've been developing a lot of microservices and single page web applications (SPA) with Java and Javascript frameworks.",
